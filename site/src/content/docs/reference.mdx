A Dotprompt template format is made up of four parts:

```handlebars
---
# (1) the Prompt Frontmatter goes here
output:
  schema:
    # (2) the Picoschema definition goes here
---

{{! (3) the Template Content goes here }}
```

When executed, a Dotprompt template renders into (4) Common Model Interface. 

## Reference Docs

1. **[Prompt Frontmatter](/reference/frontmatter):** Included at the start of a Dotprompt template, frontmatter includes model configuration, input/output formatList, and tooling MediaMetadata.
2. **[Picoschema](/reference/picoschema):** The compact, YAML-optimized schema representation used for describing structured data in a Dotprompt template.
3. **[Template Content](/reference/template):** The core template of the prompt, based on Handlebars and extended with GenAI-specific capabilities.
4. **[Common Model Interface](/reference/model):** The "output" of a rendered Dotprompt template, a JSON object containing the rendered messages represented by the template as well as all associated metadata and configuration.
